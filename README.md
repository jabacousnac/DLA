# DLA
Python code for simple Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) simulations 
The whole local folder from codebase is present in the repo. 
1. display2D.py runs DLA for a 2D lattice for only one particle roaming around the target. 
2. multiparticle_DLA.py runs DLA for a 2D lattice but with n number of particles being generated at the same time. 
3. make_film.ipynb: self explanatory
4. .xslx files show results for changing parameters for DLA
